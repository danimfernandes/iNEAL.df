# Practical Training Session I #
# Introduction to Ancient Population Genetics for Non-Geneticists #

We will guide you through some of the most commonly used methods in Neanderthal paleogenomics, and help you produce some simple statistical tests and plots. These will include mitochondrial DNA neighbour-joining trees, f4-statistics, and estimates of introgression quantification using f4-ratio.

# f4-statistics #
## Replicating Qin & Stoneking 2015 ##

Qin & Stoneking used f4-statistics to investigate how many alleles modern populations (X) shared with Neanderthals versus Denisovans (or vice versa).
